ESPectro32-NewYear
==================

A super simple project targeted for ESPectro32 IoT Dev Board to download and play Merry Xmas and New Year (or basically any) song, plus LED Matrix animations. Made based on `Espressif IoT Development Framework`_ (ESP-IDF). 

## ESPectro32

ESPectro32 is an IoT development board based-on ESP32 MCU, made by DycodeX. You can get one from [Makestro Shop](https://shop.makestro.com/product/espectro32/) or [Cytron](https://www.cytron.io/p-espectro32)


## Getting Started

* Clone this repo
* Update submodules which this project depends on: git submodule update --init --recursive
* There's a symbolic link arduino-esp32. Change (recreate) the symbolic link to point to your local arduino-esp32 folder.
* Try to `make`. Fingers crossed :)
