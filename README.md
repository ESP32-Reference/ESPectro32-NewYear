ESPectro32-NewYear
==================

A super simple project targeted for ESPectro32 IoT Dev Board to download and play Merry Xmas and New Year (or basically any) song, plus LED Matrix animations. The project is based on [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) (ESP-IDF). 

## ESPectro32

ESPectro32 is an IoT development board based-on ESP32 MCU, made by DycodeX. You can get one from [Makestro Shop](https://shop.makestro.com/product/espectro32/) or [Cytron](https://www.cytron.io/p-espectro32)


## Getting Started

* Clone this repo
* Update submodules which this project depends on: git submodule update --init --recursive
* There's a symbolic link arduino-esp32. It's a Arduino-compatible framework for ESP32. You can clone it from [here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). Change (recreate) the symbolic link to point to your local arduino-esp32 folder.
* Via Terminal/Console, on current directory, try to type `make`. Fingers crossed :)
